## About the Collection

This digital collection is a survey of reportedly haunted locations in Oregon, mostly consisting of photographs of historic buildings and cemeteries. The collection consists of 21 images taken from 1855 to 1977 in several regions of Oregon, including the Willamette Valley, the coast, and Southern Oregon. Locations were designated haunted by personal recollection of folk legends as well as by other Oregonians. Objects were collected through a combination of national and state repositories. The collection offers a different look at a survey of historical places in Oregon by taking into account Oregonâ€™s long history of superstition and folk legends. Using this site, objects may be displayed on a timeline or plotted on a map. In this way, they are placed in spacial and temporal context.

The repository features objects from the [Library of Congress](http://www.loc.gov/), [Oregon Digital](https://oregondigital.org), and the [National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/)

This collection was created Spring term 2023 for LIB 410 under the instruction of Kate Thornhill and Michele Pflug.
