# Haunted Locations in Oregon
This digital collection consists of data objects that document reportedly haunted locations in Oregon.
It was created as a final project for the Humanities Research Data Management class (LIB410) taught by
Kate Thornhill at the University of Oregon in 2023 Spring term. 

## Course Description
The Humanities Research Data Management class, sometimes referred to as Humanities Data Management, provided students the theory and practical experience to design a humanities data collection. The course taught students how to collect, process, archive,
and publish the data which was retrieved from GLAMs (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums). Students created a thematical 
digital collection acting in the capacity as researchers. Methodologies developed in class focused on technical, legal, ethical, and social aspects of curating the collection. Experience was gained by finding, assessing, organizing, and reformatting data; creating and remediating descriptive metadata; evaluating and determining copyright and licensing; writing a data management plan using the standards set by the National Endowment for the Humanities, and sharing thematic research digital collections using GitHub and CollectionBuilder, an open-source platform.

## Collection description and website address
This digital collection is a survey of reportedly haunted locations in Oregon, mostly consisting of photographs of historic buildings and cemeteries. The collection consists of 21 images taken from 1855 to 1977 in several regions of Oregon, including the Willamette Valley, the coast, and Southern Oregon. Locations were designated haunted by personal recollection of folk legends as well as by other Oregonians. Objects were collected through a combination of national and state repositories. The collection offers a different look at a survey of historical places in Oregon by taking into account Oregonâ€™s long history of superstition and folk legends.

## Data Management Plan
The group's Data Management Plan (DMP) documents their data curation methodology, technical expertise and roles,
file standards and formatting, privacy and security concerns, and data preservation and retention. Two appendices are included: Appendix A is the Metadata Application Profile guidelines, and Appendix B is our tongue-in-cheek research into
an apparation in one of our data objects. Finally, a works cited section includes our references.

## Lyrics
"Well the highway is alive tonight
But nobody's kidding nobody about where it goes
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
With the ghost of old Tom Joad"
-Bruce Springsteen
