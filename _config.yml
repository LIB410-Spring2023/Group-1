description: "This digital collection is a survey of reportedly haunted locations in Oregon, mostly consisting of photographs of historic buildings and cemeteries. The collection consists of 22 images taken from 1855 to 1977 in several regions of Oregon, including the Willamette Valley, the coast, and Southern Oregon. Locations were designated haunted by personal recollection of folk legends as well as by other Oregonians. Objects were collected through a combination of national and state repositories. The collection offers a different look at a survey of historical places in Oregon by taking into account Oregonâ€™s long history of superstition and folk legends."
